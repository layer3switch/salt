==========
Windows
==========

Salt currently has experimental support for Salt Minions on Windows.

There are no plans for the forseeable future to develop a Salt
Master on Windows. For now you must run your Salt Master on a
supported operating system to control your Salt Minions on Windows.

Many of the standard Salt modules have been ported to work on Windows
and many of the Salt States currently work on Windows, as well.

Installation
============

Work is under way to create a Windows installer for Salt, but for now
one must install each dependency separately and configure Salt to
run on your Windows host.

Rather than send you on a wild goose chase across the internet, we've
collected most of the dependency installers in our github repo for you.
