=========================
Salt 0.10.3 Release Notes
=========================

The latest taste of Salt has come, this release has many fixes and feature
additions. Modifications have been made to make ZeroMQ connections more
reliable, the begining of the ACL system is in place, a new command line
parsing system has been added, dynamic module distribution has become more
environment aware, the new `master_fingerprint` option and many more!

Major Features
==============

ACL System
----------

The new ACL system has been introduced. The ACL system allows for system users
other than root to execute salt commands. Users can be allowed to execute
specific commands in the same way that minions are opened up to the peer
system.

The configuration value to open up the ACL system is called ``client_acl``
and is configured like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    client_acl:
      fred:
        - test..*
        - pkg.list_pkgs

Where `fred` is allowed access to functions in the test module and to the
``pkg.list_pkgs`` function.

Parsing System
--------------

Pedro Algavio, aka s0undt3ch, has added a substantial update to the command
line parsing system that makes the help message output much cleaner and easier
to search through.

More State Output Options
-------------------------

Some major changes have been made to the state output system. In the past state
return data was printed in a very verbose fasion and only states that failed or
made changes were printed by default. Now two options can be passed to the
master and minion configuration files to change the behavior of the state
output. State output can be set to verbose (default) or non-verbose with the
``state_verbose`` option:

.. code-block:: yaml

    state_verbose: False

It is noteworthy that the state_verbose option used to be set to `False` by
default but has been changed to `True` by default in 0.10.3 due to many
requests for the change.

Te next option to be aware of new and called ``state_output``. This option
allows for the state output to be set to `full` (default) or `terse`.

The `full` output is the standard state output, but the new `terse` output
will print only one line per state making the output much easier to follow when
executing a large state system.

.. code-block:: yaml

    state_output: terse
