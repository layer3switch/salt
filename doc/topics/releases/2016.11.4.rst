Salt 2016.11.4 Release Notes
============================

Version 2016.11.4 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2016.11.0 <release-2016-11-0>`.


AIX Fixes
=========

Added module execution support for user and group


Minion Data Cache Fixes
=======================

Added Memcache booster for the minion data cache.
Memcache is an additional cache layer that keeps a limited amount of data
fetched from the minion data cache for a limited period of time in memory that
makes cache operations faster. It doesn't make much sence for the ``localfs``
cache driver but helps for more complex drivers like ``consul``.
For more details see ``memcache_expire_seconds`` and other ``memcache_*``
options in the master config reverence.

Salt-Cloud Fixes
================

2016.11.0 added support for templating userdata files for the :mod:`ec2
<salt.cloud.clouds.ec2>` driver, using the :conf_master:`renderer` option from
the master config file. However, as the default renderer first evaluates jinja
templating, followed by loading the data as a YAML dictionary, this results in
unpredictable results when userdata files are comprised of non-YAML data (which
they generally are).

2016.11.4 fixes this by setting the default renderer used to template userdata
files to ``jinja``, and adding a new cloud profile config parameter called
``userdata_renderer``. If this option is not set, then salt-cloud will fall
back to using the new master configuration parameter
:conf_master:`userdata_renderer`.

In addition, the other cloud drivers which support setting a ``userdata_file``
(:mod:`azurearm <salt.cloud.clouds.azurearm>`, :mod:`nova
<salt.cloud.clouds.nova>`, and :mod:`openstack <salt.cloud.clouds.openstack>`)
have had templating support added to bring them to feature parity with ec2's
implementation of the ``userdata_file`` param.
