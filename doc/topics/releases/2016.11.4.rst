Salt 2016.11.4 Release Notes
============================

Version 2016.11.4 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2016.11.0 <release-2016-11-0>`.

Minion Data Cache Fixes
=======================

Added Memcache booster for the minion data cache.
Memcache is an additional cache layer that keeps a limited amount of data
fetched from the minion data cache for a limited period of time in memory that
makes cache operations faster. It doesn't make much sence for the ``localfs``
cache driver but helps for more complex drivers like ``consul``.
For more details see ``memcache_expire_seconds`` and other ``memcache_*``
options in the master config reverence.
