Salt 0.10.4 Release Notes
=========================

The latest taste of Salt has come, this release has many fixes and feature
additions. Modifications have been made to make ZeroMQ connections more
reliable, the begining of the ACL system is in place, a new command line
parsing system has been added, dynamic module distribution has become more
environment aware, the new `master_finger` option and many more!

Major Features
==============

External Authentication System
------------------------------

Access Control System
---------------------

Master Tops System
------------------

Next Level Solaris Support
--------------------------

Security
========

A vulnerability in the handshake was found and has been repaired, old minions
should be able to connect to a new master, so as usual the master should be
updated first and then the minions.

Pillar Updates
--------------

The pillar communication has been updated to add some extra levels of
verification that the intended minion is the only one allowed to gather the
data. Once all minions and the master are updated to salt 0.10.4 please
activate pillar 2 by changing the `pillar_version` in the master config to
`2`. This will be set to `2` by default in a future release.
