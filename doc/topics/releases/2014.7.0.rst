Salt 2014.7.0 Release Notes - Codename Helium
=============================================

This release is the largest Salt release ever, with more features and commits
then any previous release of Salt. Everything from the new RAET transport to
major updates in Salt Cloud and the merging of Salt API into the main project.

Major Features
==============

RAET Transport Option
---------------------

This has been a HUGE ammount of work, but the beta release of salt with raet
is ready to go. RAET is a reliable queuing transport system that has been
developed in partnership with a number of large enterprises to give Salt
an alternative to ZeroMQ and a way to get Salt to scale well beyond tens of
thousands of servers. Unlike ZeroMQ, RAET is completely asynchronus in every
aspect of its operation and has been developed using the flo programming
paradigmn. This allows for many new capabilities to be added to Salt in the
upcomming releases.

Please keep in mind that this is a beta release of RAET and
we hope for bugs to be worked out, performance to be better realized and more
in the Lithium release.

Simply stated, users running salt with RAET should expect some hicups as we
hammer out the update. This is a BETA release of Salt RAET.

For information about how to use Salt with RAET please see the tutorial:

-------------------

The Salt sceduler system has recived MAJOR enhancements, allowing for cron like
sceduling and much mroe granular timing routines.

LXC Runner Enhancements
-----------------------

The Salt LXC management system has recived a number of enhancements which make
running an LXC cloud entirely from Salt an easy proposition.

Next Gen Docker Management
--------------------------

The Docker support in Salt has been increased at least ten fold. The Docker
api is now completely exposed and Salt ships with Docker data tracking
systems which make automating Docker deployments very easy.
