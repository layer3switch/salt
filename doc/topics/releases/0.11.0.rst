Salt 0.11.0 Release Notes
=========================

Salt 0.11.0 is here, with some highly sought after and exciting features.
These features include the new overstate system, the reactor system, a new
state run scope component called __context__, the begining of the search
system (still needs a great deal of work), multiple package states, the
MySQL returner and a better system to arbitrarily reference outputters.

It is also noteworthy that we are chaging how we mark release numbers. For
the life of the project we have been pushing every release with features
and fixes as point releases. We will now be releasing point releases for
bug fixes only on a more regular basis and major feature releases on a
slightly less regular basis. This means that the next release will be a
bugfix only release with a version number of 0.11.1. The next feature release
will be named 0.12.0 and will mark the end of life for the 0.11 series.

Major Features
==============

OverState
---------

The overstate system is a simple way to manage rolling state executions across
many minions. The overstate allows for the state system to be managed very
cleanly from the salt master.
