Salt 0.10.2 Release Notes
=========================

0.10.2 is out! This release comes with enhancements to the pillar interface,
cleaner ways to access the salt-call capabilities in the API, minion data
caching and the event system has been added to salt minions.

There have also been updates to the zeromq functions, many more tests
(thanks to sponsors, the code sprint and many contributors) and a swath
of bug fixes.

Major Features
==============

Ext Pillar Modules
------------------

The ranks of available Salt modules directories sees a new member in 0.10.2.
With the popularity of pillar a higher demand has arrisen for ``ext_pillar``
interfaces to be more like regular Salt module additions. Now ext_pillar
interfaces can be added in the same way as other modules, just drop it into
the pillar directory in the salt source.

Minion Events
-------------

In 0.10.0 an event system was added to the Salt master. 0.10.2 adds the event
system to the minions as well. Now event can be published on a local minion
as well.

The minions can also send events back up to the master. This means that Salt is
able to communicate individual events from the minions back up to the Master
which are not associated with command.

Minion Data Caching
-------------------

When pillar was introduced the landscape for available data was greatly
enhanced. The minion's began sending grain data back to the master on a
regular basis.

The new config option on the master called ``minion_data_cache`` instructs the
Salt master to maintain a cache of the minion's grains and pillar data in the
cachedir. This option is turned off by default to avoid hitting the disk more,
but when enabled the cache is used to make grain matching from the salt command
more powerful, since the minions that will match can be pre determined.

Test Updates
