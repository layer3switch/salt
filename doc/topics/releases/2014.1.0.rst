Proxy Minions¬
-------------¬
¬
Initial basic support for Proxy Minions is in this release.  Documentation can¬
be found :doc:`here </topics/proxyminion>`.⌴⌴¬
¬
Proxy minions are a developing feature in Salt that enables control of¬
devices that cannot run a minion.  Examples include network gear like switches¬
and routers that run a proprietary OS but offer an API, or "dumb"¬
devices that just don't have the horsepower or ability to handle a Python VM.¬
¬
Proxy minions can be difficult to write, so a simple REST-based example proxy¬
is included.  A Python bottle-based webserver can be found at⌴¬
http://github.com/cro/salt-proxy-rest as an endpoint for this proxy.¬

This is an ALPHA-quality feature.  There are a number of issues with it
currently, mostly centering around process control, logging, and inability to
work in a masterless configuration.
