Salt 0.13.0 Release Notes
=========================

The lucky number 13 has turned the corner! From cli notifications when quitting
a salt command, to substantial improvements on Windows, Salt 0.13.0 has
arrived!

Major Features
==============

Improved file.recuse Performance
--------------------------------

The file.recurse system has been deployed and used in a vast array of
situations. Fixes to the file state and module have led towards opening up
new ways of running file.recuse to make it faster. Now the file.recurse
state will download fewer files and will run substantially faster.
