Salt 2014.7.3 Release Notes
===========================

:release: TBA

Version 2014.7.3 is a bugfix release for :doc:`2014.7.2
</topics/releases/2014.7.2>`.

Changes:

- Multi-master minions mode no longer routes fileclient operations asymetrically.
  This fixes the source of many multi-master bugs where the minion would
  become unrepsonsive from one or more masters.

Known issues:

- In multimaster mode, a minion may become temporarily unresponsive
  if modules or pillars are refreshed at the same time that one
  or more masters are down. This can be worked around by setting
  'auth_timeout' and 'auth_tries' down to shorter periods.
