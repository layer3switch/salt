==================
Salt Stack Roadmap
==================

Salt is the core of a more complete goal, the Salt Stack. The Salt Stack is a
complete infrastructure management system which is comprised of many
components all functioning on top of Salt.

The majority of the functionality of the Salt Stack happens directly inside
Salt, but the information derived from Salt needs to be used to create a
transparent view of the infrastructure as a whole.

The information used in Salt States will be matched via a higher interface
and the low salt data will be visualized. This will allow the state data to
appear in the web interface.

To make this possible the need is to build up the Salt modules to support
more stuff
