Altering States
===============

The state altering system is used to make sure that states are evaluated exactly
as the user expects.  It can be used to double check that a state preformed
exactly how it was expected to, or to make 100% sure that a state only runs
under certain conditions.  The use of unless or onlyif options help make states
even more stateful.  The check_cmds option helps ensure that the result of a
state is evaluated correctly.

Unless
------

Use unless to only run if any of the specified commands return False.

.. code-block:: yaml

    vim:
      pkg.installed:
        - unless:
            - rpm -q vim-enhanced
            - ls /usr/bin/vim

This state will not run if the vim-enhanced package is already installed, or if
/usr/bin/vim exists.  It gives more granular control over when a state should be
run.

Onlyif
------

Onlyif is the opposite of Unless.  If all of the commands in onlyif return True,
then the state is run.

.. code-block:: yaml

    stop-volume:
      module.run:
        - name: glusterfs.stop_volume
        - m_name: work
        - onlyif:
            - gluster volume status work
        - order: 1

    remove-volume:
      module.run:
        - name: glusterfs.delete
        - m_name: work
        - onlyif:
            - gluster volume info work
        - watch:
          - cmd: stop-volume

This will ensure that the stop_volume and delete modules are only run if the
gluster commands return back a 0 ret value.

Check_Cmd
---------

Check Command is used for determining that a state did or did not run as
expected.

.. code-block:: yaml

    comment-repo:
      file.replace:
        - path: /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
        - pattern: ^enabled=0
        - repl: enabled=1
        - check_cmd:
            - grep 'enabled=0' /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo && return 1 || return 0

This will attempt to do a replace on all enabled=0 in the .repo file, and
replace them with enabled=1.  The check_cmd is just a bash command.  It will do
a grep for enabled=0 in the file, and if it finds any, it will return a 0, which
will prompt the && portion of the command to return a 1, causing check_cmd to
set the state as failed.  If it returns a 1, meaning it didn't find any
'enabled=0' it will hit the || portion of the command, returning a 0, and
declaring the function succeeded.

Overriding Checks
=================

There are two commands used for the above checks.

`mod_run_check` is used to check for onlyif and unless.  If the goal is to
override the global check for these to variables, include a mod_run_check in the
salt/states/ file.

`mod_run_check_cmd` is used to check for the check_cmd options.  To override
this one, include a mod_run_check_cmd in the states file for the state.
