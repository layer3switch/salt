'''

General map/reduce style salt-runner for aggregating identical results returned
by several different minions.
Aggregated results are sorted by the size of the minion pools which returned
identical results.

Useful for playing the game: " some of these things are not like the others... "
when identifying discrepancies in a large infrastructure managed by salt.

    Return the aggregated and sorted results from a salt command submitted by a

    CLI Example #1: ( functionally equivalent to "salt-run manage.up" )

        salt-run diff.hash "*" test.ping

    CLI Example #2: ( find an "outlier" minion config file )

        salt-run diff.hash "*" file.get_hash /etc/salt/minion
